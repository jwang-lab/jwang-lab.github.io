The Wang Lab aims to discovering and mining rules or mechanisms behind biological and biomedical data, supporting disclosing the mystery of life, cell development, and human diseases. The current research is mainly dedicated to 
to deep learning modeling and algorithm development on emerging 3D imaging and single-cell spatial multi-omics data to explore fundamental biological and biomedical problems, especially in neural science diseases.


There are three main areas of research:

1. **Deep learning approaches in modeling single-cell and spatial transcriptomics**: Developing noval deep learning algorithms for neural diseases using single cell multiomics and spatial transcriptomics
2. **Machine learning approaches and applications in molecular dynamics**: Using graph neural networks and related computational approaches for molecular dynamics studies
3. **Software and webserver development**: Developing bioinformatic software and webserver for biological researchers

<!-- ### Technologies and methods
The Wang Lab is a bioinformatic group that uses a wide range of machine learning technologies to explore biological and bimedical questions, mainly using single cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, deep learning. -->

<!-- ### Collaborators
We work with closely with numerous collaborators, including the [State Lab](https://www.mstatelab.com/) and [Bender Lab](https://benderlab.ucsf.edu/lab-members) at UCSF, the [Devlin Lab](https://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/about-us/our-people/faculty/bernie-j-devlin-phd) at UPMC, the [Roeder Lab](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~roeder/) at Carnegie Mellon, the [Sestan Lab](http://medicine.yale.edu/lab/sestan/index.aspx), and the [Talkowski lab](http://talkowski.mgh.harvard.edu/) at Harvard. -->
